In this level, we are given an executable file: level03.

Using the scp command, we can copy the file to our local machine and decompile 
it to understand its behavior.
We can now see that 'system("/usr/bin/env echo Exploit me")' is executed by 
the program.

Since the file level03 has the permission of the flag03 user, we can exploit it 
to execute the getflag command.
To do this, we can override the echo command by creating a script and changing 
the PATH environment variable:
	echo 'getflag' > /tmp/echo
	chmod +x /tmp/echo
	export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
