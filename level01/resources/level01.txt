In the /etc/passwd file, we can find an encrypted password for the user flag01.
	-> The /etc/passwd file contains basic information about users on the system.

We can crack this password using John the Ripper (level00 was an hint), which is
a password cracking tool.
John gives us the decrypted password: abcdefg.

We now have the password for the user flag01, so we can switch to this user and 
execute the getflag command to retrieve the flag.
