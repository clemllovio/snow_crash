Here we have a binary file that we have ton inspect and a token file

We can see it reads whatever file we give it but rejects any file named token

The idea is to create a symbolic link on the token file to another file which must not be named token

Then we can execute the binary with the newly created symlink

ln -s TARGET LINK NAME
