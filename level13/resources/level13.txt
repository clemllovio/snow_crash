In this level, we are given an executable file: level13.

Using the scp command, we can copy the file to our local machine and decompile 
it to understand its behavior.
We can now see that the ft_des function is called only if a specific condition is met.. 
If we manage to bypass this condition, ft_des will be called, and we will get the flag.

To do that we can use gdb.
disas main
	-> disassembles the main function so we can get the instruction that 
	performs the conditional check 

Now that we find the address of the condition we can set a breakpoint:
	break *0x0804859f
	run

When the breakpoint is hit, we overwrite the instruction at that address with a 
jump instruction that has no condition:
	set {unsigned char}0x0804859f = 0xeb
	continue

And we now have the flag
