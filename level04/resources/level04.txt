Here we have a perl script called level04.pl

We can see in the script it runs a server on port 4747 with [localhost](http://localhost) as ip

With `cat /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/*`  we can see pages allowed by apache2

We can see it has the [level04.pl](http://level04.pl) script accessible within the server.

To access it, we must connect to the website with [http://192.168.64.2:4747/level04.pl]

Here we must figure out how we can send malicious content to the script

Inside the script we can see it executes whatever parameter is given to the variable x

So the goal is to inject the getflag command to the perl script since it has flag04 permissions.

curl "http://192.168.64.2:4747/level04.pl?x=\`getflag\`"
