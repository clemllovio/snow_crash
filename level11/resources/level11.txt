In this level we get a .lua file that will a run a TCP server that prompts the 
client for a password.

The idea is to inject the getflag command when the password is prompted.
	-> There is a vulnerability because the password is passed unsanitzed into a
	 shell command.

To exploit it, connect to the server using nc 127.0.0.1 5151, and when asked for
 the password, input: ; getflag > /tmp/flag11.
