In this level, we are given an executable file (level09) and a file that 
contains a token.

Using the scp command, we can copy both file to our local machine and decompile 
the executable to understand its behavior.

We see that the program does a rot + i (character rotation with increasing 
shift) on the token. 
To decrypt the token, we just have to write a script that does the reverse o
peration (rot - i).

We now have the password to switch to the flag09 user and execute the getflag command.
