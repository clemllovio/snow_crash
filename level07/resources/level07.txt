In this level, we are given an executable file: level07.

Using the scp command, we can copy the file to our local machine and decompile it to understand its behavior.
We can now see that 'asprintf(&var_1c, "/bin/echo %s ", getenv("LOGNAME"))' is executed by the program.

Since the file level03 has the permission of the flag07 user, we can exploit it to execute the getflag command.
To do this, we can change the LOGNAME environment variable : export LOGNAME="; getflag".
This will make the program execute getflag.
